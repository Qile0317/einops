## Load a batch of images to play with

Here we the einops example data, an `image_tensor` object -  a thin wrapper around a 3D and 4D `base::array`. The data 6 images of shape 96x96 with 3 color channels packed into tensor.

```{r load_einops_image}
ims <- get(data("einops_image"))
print(dim(ims))
```

```{r}
# display the first image (whole 4d tensor can't be rendered)
ims[1]
```

```{r}
# second image in a batch
ims[2]
```

```{r}
# rearrange, as the name suggests, rearranges elements
# below we swapped height and width.
# In other words, transposed first two axes (dimensions)
rearrange(ims[1], "h w c -> w h c")
```
